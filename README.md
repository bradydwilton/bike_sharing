# Overview of Bike Ride Analysis

The following analysis was prepared using Tableau Public to provide an analysis how customers used bikes in NYC's CitiBike business.

The accompanying data for this report can be found [here](https://public.tableau.com/profile/brady6686#!/vizhome/BikeTripAnalysisChallenge/BikeTripAnalysis?publish=yes)

This analysis was prepared with three questions in mind:
1. Who uses the bike sharing service?
2. When are bikes used the most?
3. How long does the typical bike trip last?

### 1. Who uses the bike sharing service?



The `Customer Type` and `Gender Breakdown` pie charts show that the highest amount of usage comes from male riders who subscribe to the service.  </br>
The `Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)` heatmap shows that both men and women have similar usage patterns, with the service being used the most during rush hour (8 A.M and 5-6 P.M.). However, as shown in the `Gender Breakdown` pie chart, there are more male customers during those hours than female.
